# Dino Game AI
dino game implemented with pygame

Two ways the ai is implemented: neural network and genetic algorithm

Automatically set to only run game

To run neural network ai: change argument of start in main.py to `run_AI=True, ai='nn'`

To run genetic algorithm ai: change argument of start in main.py to `run_AI=True, ai='genetic'`
